  ## Description
  
  During this project, a group of well rounded individuals collaborated to create a parking app that would be useful for both the owner of the site, as well as the customers. This project is going to be used for a private parking lot manager. As the owner, you will be able to create new parking lots, make changes to lots, and manage all criterea for the lot. As the user, you will be able to log in, add each one of your vehicles to your profile, and you will be able pay and manage the parking of all of your vehicles. This project was built using Graphql for the database, react and tailwind css for the front end.
